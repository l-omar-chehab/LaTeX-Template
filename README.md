# LaTeX Template

Many productions such as articles or books are written in LaTeX, which provides easy-to-use professional formatting of text and equations.

Some files, such as the bibliography, will be used time and time again across projects. It saves time to put some effort in making them look neat. 

This repository includes a full LaTeX template, including advice on how to write a good article.
